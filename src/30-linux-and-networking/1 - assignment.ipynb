    "# Part 1: Introduction to Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning objectives of this assignment are to familiarize you with\n",
    "basic Linux shell commands, standard input, standard output, standard\n",
    "error, and pipes.  You will use these ideas when interacting with the\n",
    "Linux shell to operate your drone.  Additionally you will use these\n",
    "ideas in the next section when working on the networking exercises.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "When you enter a command in a shell, it executes a program. These programs read\n",
    "from a stream, known as \"standard input\" and write to two output streams,\n",
    "\"standard output\" and \"standard error\". When you `print` in python, it writes\n",
    "its output to standard output. In another language, such as C, you use other\n",
    "functions, such as `printf` to write to standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to writing to standard output, a program can read from standard\n",
    "input. The program `cat`, short for concatenate, reads from standard input\n",
    "and writes the result to standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Output (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a python program that prints \"Hello world\" to standard output. *Save\n",
    "   the program as `hello1.py` and submit it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a python program that prints \"Hello world\" to standard output using\n",
    "   `sys.stdout`. *Save the program as `hello2.py` and submit it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a bash script that prints \"Hello World\" to standard output. *Save the\n",
    "   script as `hello.sh` and submit it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Input (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Write answers to questions 1-2 in`shell.txt`. Submit this file.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run `cat` with no arguments. Why does `cat` seem like it is hanging?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When you run `cat`, type a message into your terminal, and press\n",
    "   `Control-D`. Describe what `cat` does. Make sure to include which streams\n",
    "   are being used, and for what purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a python program `my_cat.py` that reads a message from\n",
    "   standard input and prints to standard output, just as `cat` does.\n",
    "   You only need to reproduce the behavior of `cat` when run with no\n",
    "   arguments.  *Submit this file.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipes (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipes are used to redirect standard input, standard output, and standard error.\n",
    "First, `>` is used to redirect standard output to a file. For example, `echo \"Hello World\" > test.txt` will write the string `Hello World` to `test.txt`. *Write answers to questions 1-4 in `shell.txt`. Submit this file.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create files `one.txt`, `two.txt` and `three.txt` that contain the strings\n",
    "   `1`, `2`, and `3`, respectively using `echo` and output redirect. \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. By convention, almost all shell programs read input from standard input, and\n",
    "   write their output to standard output. Any error messages are printed to\n",
    "   standard error. You can chain shell programs together by using `|`. For\n",
    "   example, the program `ls` writes the contents of a directory to standard\n",
    "   output. The program `sort` reads from standard input, sorts what\n",
    "   it reads, and writes the sorted content to standard output. So you can use\n",
    "   `ls | sort` to print out a sorted directory list. Read the man page for sort\n",
    "   (`man sort`) to learn how to sort in reverse order. What is the bash script (using `|`) that prints the contents of a directory in reverse alphabetical order? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use `cat`, `|` and `echo` to print `hello world.` Do not write to any files\n",
    "   and use both commands one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This is not the simplest way to print hello world. Can you suggest\n",
    "   a simpler way? (We asked you to do it the more complicated way to practice\n",
    "   with pipes.) \n",
    "5. Write a python script that reads from standard input, sorts lines in reverse\n",
    "      alphabetical order, and prints the result. It should behave like `sort -r`.  It does not need to process any command line arguments.\n",
    "      *Submit your script in a file called `my_reverse_sort.py`. Do not submit this script in `shell.txt`*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Error (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to standard input and standard output, there is a third stream,\n",
    "standard error. If there is an error in a chain of pipes, it will be printed to\n",
    "the terminal rather than buried in the input to the next program.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recall that `ls -a | sort > sorted.txt` puts all the names of files in\n",
    "   a directory sorted in alphabetical order into the file `sorted.txt`. If you\n",
    "   modify the command to be `ls -a -hippo | sort > sorted.txt`, what text is in\n",
    "   `sorted.txt`, what is outputted as standard error, and why? *Answer this question in `shell.txt`. Submit this file.*\n",
    "2. Create a python script that prints reversed sorted output to standard error. Use it to sort `ls -a` instead\n",
    "   of `sort`. *Submit the file containing the script as `my_sort_status.py`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Part 2: Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning objectives of this section are to familiarize you with\n",
    "how a TCP/IP server works and how to explore a network to find what\n",
    "computers (and robots!) are around, and then how to connect to them.\n",
    "We will use tools at a lower level than the robot programming\n",
    "interface you will use in the rest of the course, in order to focus on\n",
    "the general networking ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Netcat (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "The command `nc` is short for \"netcat\" and is similar to `cat` but works over\n",
    "network connections. It reads from standard input and writes its contents not\n",
    "to standard output, but to a specified server. *Write your answers in the\n",
    "corresponding sections of `networking.txt`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Point `nc` to google.com as follows: `nc www.google.com 80` When you first\n",
    "   connect, it will be silent. Then type any arbitrary text and press enter.\n",
    "   What is the error number?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now type some valid http into nc: `GET / HTTP/1.1`. What is the output?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now use `nc` to make a server. In one window, type `nc -l 12345`. This\n",
    "   will cause `nc` to listen on port 12345. In another terminal on the same\n",
    "   machine, type `nc localhost 12345`. You can type a message in one window\n",
    "   and it will appear in the other window (and vice versa). This trick can be\n",
    "   very useful to test basic internet connectivity - if the client and server\n",
    "   can send packets at all. *No answer is required for this question.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. By convention, `roscore` listens on port 11311. Try using `nc` to connect to\n",
    "   port 11311 on a machine where `roscore` is running, such as the Pi on your\n",
    "   drone. What protocol is roscore using to communicate (think application layer)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Talking to Your Robot (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, this assignment has required access to `localhost`, the local machine\n",
    "you are connected to, and `google.com`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly, the base station and robot are connected over TCP/IP to the same\n",
    "local network. Then you can look up your machine's IP address (`ifconfig` in\n",
    "Unix; other ways in other OSes), and your robot's IP address, and connect them.\n",
    "How can you find your robot's IP address? Well it's a chicken-and-egg problem.\n",
    "If you knew the IP address, you can connect to the robot and run `ifconfig` and\n",
    "find the IP address, but you don't know the IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do? There are several solutions. *Write the answers to the following\n",
    "questions in `networking.txt`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Brainstorm how you can solve the chicken-and-egg program to connect to\n",
    "your robot. List three different solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Look Ma, No Internet! (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about if there *is* no public internet connection? What if you want to\n",
    "fly your drone in the wilderness? Well, there does exist cellular modems and\n",
    "satellite connections, but you can also tell your drone to act as a Wifi\n",
    "Hotspot. It can create a network and run a DHCP server. You can configure this\n",
    "on your drone using the file `/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf`. Then you can connect\n",
    "your laptop's base station using the SSID and passphrase specified in that\n",
    "file, and connect to the drone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can set up your laptop as the Wifi base station and configure\n",
    "the drone to connect to its network. The details will vary depending on your\n",
    "laptop OS and settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your Pi is configured to be a Wireless AP Master by default. Connect to it with\n",
    "your base station. *Write the answers to the following questions in `networking.txt`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which machine is acting as the DHCP server?\n",
    "2. What is the Pi's IP address? What is yours?\n",
    "3. Describe another network configuration for the wifi, other than the Pi being a Wireless AP Master.  \n",
    "4. Describe three network configurations for a network allowing a basestation and PiDrone to communicate with each other.   Feel free to add additional devices, such as a cell phone performing internet connection sharing. \n",

    "## Handin\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done, use [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/i0KBPRjv) to create your assignment Github Repo.\n",
