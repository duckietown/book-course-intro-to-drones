# Part 1: Estimating Height with the Time of Flight Sensor

The time-of-flight (TOF) sensor on the drone outputs a distance
estimate.  ROS requires all distances to be in meters.  

### Questions
1. Look on the data sheet for the TOF sensor on your drone.  You can find the list of data sheets for the class <a href="https://ethidsc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DTSKY/pages/2234515516/Datasheets">here</a>.  You will be using the recommended Python library to read data from the TOF sensor.  In what units does it output distances?
