    "# Part 2: Affine Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate the Duckiedrone's position (a 2-dimensional column vector $v = [x \\; y]^T$) using the camera, you will need to use affine transformations. An affine transformation $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ is any transformation of the form $v \\to Av + b$, where $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$. The affine transformations we are interested in are *rotation*, *scale*, and *translation* in two dimensions. So, the affine transformations we will look at will map vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to other vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first look at rotation. We can rotate a column vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ about the origin by the angle $\\theta$ by premultiplying it by the following matrix:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "  \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example. Below we have the vector $[1, 2]^T$. To rotate the vector by $\\theta=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, we pre-multiply the vector by the rotation matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  \\cos \\frac{2\\pi}{3} & -\\sin \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\\\\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's look at how scale is represented. We can scale a vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ by a scale factor $s$ by pre-multiplying it by the following matrix: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  s & 0 \\\\\n",
    "  0 & s \\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can scale a single point $[1, 2]^T$ by a factor of `.5` as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "    .5 \\\\\n",

    "  <figcaption>Scaling one point</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing scaling, it is helpful to consider multiple vectors, rather than a single vector. Let's look at all the points on a rectangle and multiply each of them by the scale matrix individually to see the effect of scaling by a factor of `.5`:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",

    "  <figcaption>Scaling multiple points</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see that the rectangle was scaled by a factor of `.5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about translation? Remember that an affine transformation is of the form $v \\to Av + b$. You may have noticed that rotation and scale are represented by only a matrix $A$, with the vector $b$ effectively equal to 0. We could represent translation by simply adding a vector $b = [dx \\; dy]^T$ to our vector $v$. However, it would be convenient if we could represent all of our transformations as matrices, and then obtain a single transformation matrix that scales, rotates, and translates a vector all at once. We could not achieve such a representation if we represent translation by adding a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we represent translation (moving $dx$ in the $x$ direction and $dy$ in the $y$ direction) with a matrix? First, we append a 1 to the end of $v$ to get $v' = [x, y, 1]^T$. Then, we premultiply $v'$ by the following matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  1 & 0 & dx\\\\\n",
    "  0 & 1 & dy\\\\\n",
    "  0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we are representing our $x$ and $y$ positions with a 3-dimensional vector, we are only ever interested in the first two elements, which represent our $x$ and $y$ positions. The third element of $v'$ is *always* equal to 1. Notice how pre-multiplying $v'$ by this matrix adds $dx$ to $x$ and $dy$ to $y$.\n",

    "<code>estimateRigidTransform</code>. This function takes in two images $I_1$ and $I_2$ and a boolean $B$. The function returns a matrix estimating the affine transform that would turn the first image into the second image. The boolean $B$ indicates whether you want to estimate the affect of shearing on the image, which is another affine transform. We don't want this, so we set $B$ to <code>False</code>.\n",

    "This matrix should look familiar, but it is slightly different from the matrices we have seen in this section. Let $R$, $S$, and $T$ be the rotation, scale, and translation matrices from the above summary box. Then, $E$ is the same as $TRS$, where the bottom row of $TRS$ is removed. You can think of $E$ as a matrix that first scales a vector $u = [x, y, 1]^T$ by a factor of $s$, then rotates it by $\\theta$, then translates it by $dx$ in the $x$ direction and $dy$ in the $y$ direction, and then removes the 1 appended to the end of the vector to output $u' = [x', y']$.\n",

    "1. Your Duckiedrone is flying over a highly textured planar surface. The Duckiedrone's current $x$ position is $x_0$, its current $y$ position is $y_0$, and its current yaw is $\\phi_0$. Using the Raspberry Pi Camera, you take a picture of the highly textured planar surface with the Duckiedrone in this state. You move the Duckiedrone to a different state ($x_1$ is your $x$ position, $y_1$ is your $y$ position, and $\\phi_1$ is your yaw) and then take a picture of the highly textured planar surface using the Raspberry Pi Camera. You give these pictures to <code>esimateRigidTransform</code> and it returns a matrix $E$ in the form shown above. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Write expressions for $x_1$, $y_1$, and $\\phi_1$. Your answers should be in terms of $x_0$, $y_0$, $\\phi_0$, and the elements of $E$. Assume that the Duckiedrone is initially is located at the origin and aligned with the axes of the global coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Hint 1: Your solution does not have to involve matrix multiplication or other matrix operations. Feel free to pick out specific elements of the matrix using normal 0-indexing, i.e. $E[0][2]$.\n",
    "  * Hint 2: Use the function arctan2 in some way to compute the yaw.\n"
