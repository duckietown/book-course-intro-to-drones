    "Ideally, we would hope that the parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ are enough to rotate any point $\\mathbf{p}$ (distance $d$ from the origin) to any other point $\\mathbf{p'}$ (also distance $d$ from the origin, since rotations do not change distance). Upon closer thought, it would seem as if we have more than enough parameters to do this, since it only takes two parameters $(\\theta, \\phi)$ to describe all points on the 3D unit sphere\n",

    "Two parameters sweeping out a sphere\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this intuition is a bit off. If any one parameter is held fixed, it may be impossible for $\\mathbf{p}$ to be rotated to some other $\\mathbf{p'}$ by varying the remaining two parameters. Moreover, if a certain parameter is set to a certain problematic value, then varying the remaining two parameters will either sweep out a circle (not a sphere!), or not affect $\\mathbf{p}$ at all, depending on what $\\mathbf{p}$ is. This result is way different from what we expected! The name for this degenerate case is gimbal lock. \n",

    "Reflect on your answers to the previous 4 questions. What are the questions trying to portray? Why are the answers different? Why is $-\\pi / 2$ (i.e. pitched up $90\\degree$) a \"certain problematic value\"? What would happen to an airplane that pitched that much? Could a pilot recover from such a situation? Are 3 parameters enough to allow for rotations in all situations? "
