    "## Problem 1: Ziegler-Nichols Method\n",
    "Imagine you are flying your drone and observing its flight for tuning it. Ideally, you would tune the $K_p$ by slowly increasing its value between flights until you can see the drone moving up and down with uniform oscillations. The final $K_p$ value that causes uniform oscillations is termed as $K_u$, the ultimate gain. While, the time difference between these two peaks during osciallations is termed as $T_u$, the ultimate period.\n",

    "  **Exercises** \n",
    "   1. Given $K_u$ = 500, $T_u$ = 10. Use your $K_u$ and $T_u$ values to compute $K_p$, $K_i$, and $K_d$ using Ziegler-Nichols Method. \n",

    "## Problem 2: Flying with Velocity Control \n",
    "In velocity control, we use planar velocity measure from the camera as the process variable. The keyboard keys are used to set the setpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Exercises** \n",
    "  1. Now suppose you are flying in velocity mode over a blank white poster board. How do you expect the drone to behave and why will it behave this way? Hint: think about why we fly over a highly textured planar surface.\n"
