    "  * [Q:] *The rise time decreases when $K_{d}$ increases.\n",
    "  * [A:] *When $K_{d}$ increases, the error at time step $t+1$ decreases. This is because larger and larger $K_{d}$ results in larger and larger control signals at time step $t$. This drives the system to achieve a lower error at time step $t+1$. As the error at time step $t+1$ decreases, the slope of the true value curve increases. Since the slope increases, the rising time towards the setpoint should decrease (slightly).\n",

    "When designing a PID controller, it is important to choose a good set of $K_{p}$, $K_{i}$, and $K_{d}$; poor choices can result in undesirable behavior. The graphs in the figure below illustrate behavior resulting from unknown sets of $K_{p}$, $K_{i}$, and $K_{d}$. In each graph, the orange dot line indicates the setpoint and the black line is the true value curve. For each graph, answer the following (1-2 sentences each):\n",
