# Welcome to Duckiesky

Robots are the decathlon of computer science: to make
a robot work, you need to understand robotics, which we
define as a program that includes a sensor and an actuator.
Additionally though, you typically need to understand
systems, because your robot will use multiple programs
running on a computer to make its decisions; you need to
understand networking to make the computers talk; you need to
worry about algorithms to make efficient use of the computing
resources and prove bounds on your robot's behavior; and you
need to understand hardware, because hardware limits affect
all aspects of the robot behavior, and if your CPU overheats,
your robot isn't going anywhere.

This textbook contains assignments, projects, and technical material
related to the Duckiedrone, a small autonomous Raspberry Duckiedrone.
After taking this course, students will be able to:

* Explain the space of designs for robotic communications, safety,
  state estimation, and control.

* Apply that knowledge to construct programs for communications, safety, state estimation, and control.

* Build, program, and operate an autonomous robot drone.
