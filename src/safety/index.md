# Safety

This unit asks you to think about safety considerations with robotics. For some
of these questions, there is no one correct answer; however we will publish our
answers, and our grading rubric will allow for multiple answers.

Safety is one of the most important considerations in robotics. Imagine that
someone throws the drone at a person as hard as they can. This sort of motion
is what the robot is capable of doing using its motors and accelerating at top
speed. It is extremely important that whenever you fly your drone or operate
any robot, that you keep yourself and the people around you safe. Safety is
everyone's responsibility!

You are responsible for operating your drone in a safe manner. The
most important safety advice we can give is that each person is
responsible for the safe operation. This includes speaking up if you
see an unsafe situation, acquiring information if you do not know if
something is safe, and taking care of yourself.  (For example, don't
operate your drone when you haven't slept enough.)
