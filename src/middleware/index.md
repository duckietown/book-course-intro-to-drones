# Middleware

This unit asks you to think and learn about middleware. For our drone,
we use ROS (Robot Operating System).

This assignment will help you understand how the different components
of your drone talk with each other. ROS is a framework (known as
'middleware') for robot software development that is widely used on
both industrial and commercial settings and is currently the industry
standard in research. You will go through a few tutorials to gain
exposure to the core concepts of ROS.

Before you begin the ROS component of this assignment, read through the [ROS section of the Software Architecture portion of the Operations Manual](https://docs-old.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/software_architecture_assignment.html). This document provides a general overview of ROS. Do not worry about understanding everything in this section; we are asking you to read it only to expose you to the material you will be covering in the assignment and throughout the course.
