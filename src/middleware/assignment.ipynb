    "2. Start the `screen` session we use to fly the drone. (Look [here](https://docs.duckietown.com/daffy/opmanual-duckiedrone/flying/flying-your-drone.html#screen-environment) to refresh about the screen environment.) Use `rosnode list` to display what nodes are running when you start the screen. If you wish, take a look at the [software architecture diagram](https://docs.duckietown.com/daffy/opmanual-duckiedrone/software-architecture/introduction.html#diagram-of-the-software-architecture) and look at all of the blue ROS topics to gain a visual understanding of all of the nodes that are running. Once again, do not worry about understanding everything now, or knowing what each topic is used for- you will learn this through experience as the course progresses. *No answer is required for this question*\n",
    "3. Use `rosnode info` to find out more about as many nodes as you'd like. What is the name of the time of flight (tof) node and what topics does it publish?\n",
